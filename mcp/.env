# Crystal Structure Prediction MCP Server Environment Variables
# 
# This file contains environment variables used by the CSP MCP tool.
# Update the paths according to your system configuration.
#
# Note: If a variable is not set, postprocess.sh will use its default values.

# For more variables, see postprocess.sh -h

# Base restore path for model checkpoint
# This is the directory containing the trained model checkpoint (e.g., epoch_030000.pkl)
# Example: /path/to/csp/model/checkpoint/directory/
RESTORE_PATH=

# Model checkpoint path for MLFF (Machine Learning Force Field)
# This is the path to the MLFF model file used for energy computation and relaxation
# Example: /path/to/orb-v3-conservative-inf-mpa-20250404.ckpt
MODEL_PATH=

# Path to convex hull data file
# This file is used to calculate the energy above the convex hull (e-hull)
# Example: /path/to/convex_hull_pbe.json.bz2
CONVEX_HULL_PATH=

# Directory to save outputs (optional)
# If not set, outputs will be saved to RESTORE_PATH
# Example: /path/to/output/directory/
